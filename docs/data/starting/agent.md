## Agent Guide

- Jump to: [Agent API](#header-agent_api)

The `Agent` class is used to provide a consistent connection to the APN service. In some cases
this documentation will refer to this Agent as the "live agent" to differentiate itself from the
`MockAgent` which has feature parity but does not make a real connection to the APN service.
